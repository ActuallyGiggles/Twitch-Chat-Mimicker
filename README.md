# TwitchAutoChatter
Do you like to game/code/do other dubious deeds while watching a Twitch stream? Do you want to type in the chat, but you're just too busy with your hands?

Well, suffer no more. With the Twitch Auto Chatter (I like to call it a Mimic), you can participate with chat in telling the streamer just how bad they are at the game while you occupy your hands with... more pleasant things.

INSTRUCTIONS:
If you are NOT a developer, or aren't willing to learn Go, simply download the `mimic.exe` file and run it.

Things the `.exe` will do:
1. Help you get your OAuth, Client ID, Access Token.
2. Let you join your favorite channels.
3. Allow you to blacklist emotes.
4. Set the interval range to use between messages.

Important note: Responses are randomly delayed between 2-10 seconds of finding an emote to mimic.
